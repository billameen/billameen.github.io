            "description": "Worked in a team of 3 to build a full-stack Progressive Web App (PWA) for students to find, RSVP to, and manage campus events at NC State. Users can create an account, log in, and track their events securely, all while using token-based authentication. We built the frontend with React and Material UI to make it responsive and easy to use on any device. The backend was built with Node.js, Express, and MySQL to handle user data and events. We used Docker to make development and deployment simple and reliable.",

The app features secure login with different user roles like customers, baristas, and managers, each with access to specific tools. I developed the backend with Java and Spring Boot for handling logic, authentication, and the MySQL database, and built a responsive frontend with React, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. We followed best practices using GitHub for version control and project management.",

Built an inductive logic programming system to infer rules from structured examples, and created an adversarial agent capable of making strategic decisions for the game Connect 4. Applied optimization techniques like hill climbing and simulated annealing to solve the linear assignment problem, balancing efficiency with solution quality. These projects demonstrate a strong grasp of AI concepts, including search algorithms, logical inference, and agent-based modeling.",
